This Ansible collection, enables you to automate the building of Hyperledger Fabric networks.

It supports creating these networks within
- the IBM Hyperledger Fabric Support Offering
- Fabric Open Source Stack (Hyperledger Labs `Fabric Operations <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operator>`_  and `Fabric Operations Console <https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operations-console>`_)

Roles are provided to install the operations console and operator; additional roles and modules can then create the Fabric Network.
