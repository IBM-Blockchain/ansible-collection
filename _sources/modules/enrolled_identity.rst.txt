===================================================================

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Enroll, re-enroll, or delete an enrolled Hyperledger Fabric identity by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (required)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_authtype (required)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.

    | **Type**: str

  api_key (required)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_secret
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.

    | **Type**: str

  api_timeout
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: int
    | **Default value**: ``60``

  api_token_endpoint
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token``

  state
    ``absent`` - A certificate authority matching the specified name will be stopped and removed.

    ``present`` - Asserts that a certificate authority matching the specified name and configuration exists. If no certificate authority matches the specified name, a certificate authority will be created. If a certificate authority matches the specified name but the configuration does not match, then the certificate authority will be updated, if it can be. If it cannot be updated, it will be removed and re-created with the specified configuration.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``present``

  certificate_authority
    The certificate authority to use to enroll this identity.

    You can pass a string, which is the display name of a certificate authority registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dictionary, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`certificate_authority_info <certificate_authority_info_module>` or :ref:`certificate_authority <certificate_authority_module>` modules.

    Only required when *state* is ``present``.

    | **Type**: raw

  name
    The name of the enrolled identity.

    Only required when *state* is ``present``.

    | **Type**: str

  enrollment_id
    The enrollment ID, or user name, of an identity registered on the certificate authority for this peer.

    Only required when *state* is ``present``.

    | **Type**: str

  enrollment_secret
    The enrollment secret, or password, of an identity registered on the certificate authority for this peer.

    Only required when *state* is ``present``.

    | **Type**: str

  path (required)
    The path to the JSON file where the enrolled identity will be stored.


  hsm
    The PKCS #11 compliant HSM configuration to use for generating and storing the private key.

    | **Type**: dict

    pkcs11library
      The PKCS #11 library that should be used for generating and storing the private key.

      | **Type**: str

    label
      The HSM label that should be used for generating and storing the private key.

      | **Type**: str

    pin
      The HSM pin that should be used for generating and storing the private key.

      | **Type**: str
