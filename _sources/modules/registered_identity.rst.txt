======================================================================

.. contents::

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Register, update, or revoke an Hyperledger Fabric identity by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (required)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_authtype (required)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.

    | **Type**: str

  api_key (required)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_secret
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.

    | **Type**: str

  api_timeout
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: int
    | **Default value**: ``60``

  api_token_endpoint
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token``

  state
    ``absent`` - If an identity is registered matching the specified enrollment ID, the identity will be removed. Note that this operation is unsupported by default and must be enabled by the certificate authority.

    ``present`` - Asserts that an identity matching the specified enrollment ID and configuration is registered. If no identity matches the specified enrollment ID, the identity will be created. If an identity matches the specified enrollment ID but the configuration does not match, then the identity will be updated, if it can be. If it cannot be updated, it will be removed and re-created with the specified configuration.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``present``

  certificate_authority (required)
    The certificate authority to use to register this identity.

    You can pass a string, which is the display name of a certificate authority registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dictionary, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`certificate_authority_info <certificate_authority_info_module>` or :ref:`certificate_authority <certificate_authority_module>` modules.

    | **Type**: raw

  registrar (required)
    The identity to use when interacting with the certificate authority.

    You can pass a string, which is the path to the JSON file where the enrolled identity is stored.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`enrolled_identity_info <enrolled_identity_info_module>` or :ref:`enrolled_identity <enrolled_identity_module>` modules.

    | **Type**: raw

  hsm
    The PKCS #11 compliant HSM configuration to use for digital signatures.

    Only required if the identity specified in *registrar* was enrolled using an HSM.

    | **Type**: dict

    pkcs11library
      The PKCS #11 library that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str

    label
      The HSM label that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str

    pin
      The HSM pin that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str


  enrollment_id (required)
    The enrollment ID, or user name, of the identity to register on the certificate authority.

    | **Type**: str

  enrollment_secret
    The enrollment secret, or password, of an identity to register on the certificate authority.

    Only required when *state* is ``present``.

    | **Type**: str

  max_enrollments
    The maximum number of times that this identity can be enrolled.

    | **Type**: int
    | **Default value**: ``-1``
