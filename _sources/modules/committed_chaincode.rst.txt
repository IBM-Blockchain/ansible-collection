====================================================================================

   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Commit a chaincode definition on a Hyperledger Fabric channel by using the IBM Blockchain Platform.

This module works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.






Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (required)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_authtype (required)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.

    | **Type**: str

  api_key (required)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: str

  api_secret
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.

    | **Type**: str

  api_timeout
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    | **Type**: int
    | **Default value**: ``60``

  api_token_endpoint
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token``

  state
    ``absent`` - If a chaincode definition matching the specified name, version and configuration is committed, then an error will be thrown, as it is not possible to uncommit a chaincode definition.

    ``present`` - Asserts that a chaincode definition matching the specified name, version and configuration is committed on the specified channel. If it is not committed, then the chaincode definition with the specified name, version and configuration will be committed on the specified channel.

    | **Type**: str
    | **Default value**: ``present``

  peer (required)
    The peer to use to manage the committed chaincode definition.

    You can pass a string, which is the display name of a peer registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`peer_info <peer_info_module>` or :ref:`peer <peer_module>` modules.

    | **Type**: raw

  identity (required)
    The identity to use when interacting with the peer.

    You can pass a string, which is the path to the JSON file where the enrolled identity is stored.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`enrolled_identity_info <enrolled_identity_info_module>` or :ref:`enrolled_identity <enrolled_identity_module>` modules.

    | **Type**: raw

  msp_id (required)
    The MSP ID to use for interacting with the peer.

    | **Type**: str

  hsm
    The PKCS #11 compliant HSM configuration to use for digital signatures.

    Only required if the identity specified in *identity* was enrolled using an HSM.

    | **Type**: dict

    pkcs11library
      The PKCS #11 library that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str

    label
      The HSM label that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str

    pin
      The HSM pin that should be used for digital signatures.

      | **Type**: str


  channel (required)
    The name of the channel.

    | **Type**: str

  organizations
    The list of organizations to use to endorse the transaction for committing the chaincode definition.

    The organizations must all be members of the channel, must all have approved the chaincode definition, and must all have at least one anchor peer defined.

    You can pass strings, which are the names of organizations that are registered with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    You can also pass a dict, which must match the result format of one of the :ref:`organization_info <organization_info_module>` or :ref:`organization <organization_module>` modules.

    Only required when *state* is ``present``.

    | **Elements**: raw

  name (required)
    The name of the chaincode definition.

    | **Type**: str

  version (required)
    The version of the chaincode definition.

    | **Type**: str

  sequence (required)
    The sequence number of the chaincode definition.

    | **Type**: int

  endorsement_policy_ref
    A reference to a channel policy to use as the endorsement policy for this chaincode definition, for example */Channel/Application/MyEndorsementPolicy*.

    | **Type**: str

  endorsement_policy
    The endorsement policy for this chaincode definition.

    | **Type**: str

  endorsement_plugin
    The endorsement plugin for this chaincode definition.

    | **Type**: str

  validation_plugin
    The validation plugin for this chaincode definition.

    | **Type**: str

  init_required
    True if this chaincode definition requires called the *Init* method before the *Invoke* method, false otherwise.

    | **Type**: bool

  init_json_str
    The JSON string to pass to the Init method. If init_required is true, then the transaciton will be submitted immediately after the commit completes sucessfully. Note if the transaction fails and you wish to resubmit this will need to be done via other (non-ansible) methods

    | **Type**: string

  collections_config
    The path to the collections configuration file for the chaincode definition.

    | **Type**: str

  orderer_name
    The name of the ordering service node to get the tls-certificate from
