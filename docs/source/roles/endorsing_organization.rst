===========================================================================================

.. contents::

Synopsis
--------

This role allows you to quickly build Hyperledger Fabric components for an endorsing organization. An endorsing organization has a certificate authority and a peer.

This role works with the IBM Blockchain Platform managed service running in IBM Cloud, or the IBM Blockchain Platform software running in a Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster.

Parameters
----------

  api_endpoint (optional, str, None)
    The URL for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

  api_authtype (optional, str, None)
    ``ibmcloud`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using IBM Cloud authentication. You must provide a valid API key using *api_key*.

    ``basic`` - Authenticate to the IBM Blockchain Platform console using basic authentication. You must provide both a valid API key using *api_key* and API secret using *api_secret*.

  api_key (optional, str, None)
    The API key for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

  api_secret (optional, str, None)
    The API secret for the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``basic``.

  api_timeout (optional, integer, 60)
    The timeout, in seconds, to use when interacting with the IBM Blockchain Platform console.

  api_token_endpoint (optional, str, https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token)
    The IBM Cloud IAM token endpoint to use when using IBM Cloud authentication.

    Only required when *api_authtype* is ``ibmcloud``, and you are using IBM internal staging servers for testing.

  state (optional, str, present)
    ``absent`` - All components for the endorsing organization will be stopped and removed, if they exist.

    ``present`` - All components for the endorsing organization will be created if they do not exist, or will be updated if their current configuration does not match the expected configuration.

  organization_name (optional, str, None)
    The name of the endorsing organization.

  organization_msp_id (optional, str, None)
    The MSP ID of the endorsing organization.

  ca_admin_enrollment_id (optional, str, None)
    The enrollment ID, or user name, of the identity registered as the administrator of the certificate authority.

  ca_admin_enrollment_secret (optional, str, None)
    The enrollment secret, or password, of the identity registered as the administrator of the certificate authority.

  ca_name (optional, str, *organization_name* CA)
    The name of the certificate authority.

  ca_resources (optional, dict, None)
    The Kubernetes resource configuration for the certificate authority.

    For more information, review the documentation for the *resources* parameter of the *certificate_authority* module: `certificate_authority <../modules/certificate_authority.html>`_

  ca_storage (optional, dict, None)
    The Kubernetes storage configuration for the certificate authority.

    For more information, review the documentation for the *storage* parameter of the *certificate_authority* module: `certificate_authority <../modules/certificate_authority.html>`_

  organization_admin_enrollment_id (optional, str, None)
    The enrollment ID, or user name, of the identity registered as the administrator of the certificate authority.

  organization_admin_enrollment_secret (optional, str, None)
    The enrollment secret, or password, of the identity registered as the administrator of the organization.

  peers (optional, integer, 1)
    The number of peers.

    For development and test purposes, use one peer. Three peers provides high availability, even if one of the peers is taken down for maintenance, and is suitable for production networks.

  peer_enrollment_id (optional, str, None)
    The enrollment ID, or user name, of the identity registered for the peer.

  peer_enrollment_secret (optional, str, None)
    The enrollment secret, or password, of the identity registered for the peer.

  peer_name (optional, str, *organization_name* Peer)
    The name of the peer.

    If more than one peer is being created using the *peers* parameter, then a number will be appended to the specified peer name.

  peer_state_db (optional, str, couchdb)
    ``couchdb`` - Use CouchDB as the state database for this peer.

    ``leveldb`` - Use LevelDB as the state database for this peer.

  peer_resources (optional, dict, None)
    The Kubernetes resource configuration for the peer.

    For more information, review the documentation for the *resources* parameter of the *peer* module: `peer <../modules/peer.html>`_

  peer_storage (optional, dict, None)
    The Kubernetes storage configuration for the peer.

    For more information, review the documentation for the *storage* parameter of the *peer* module: `peer <../modules/peer.html>`_

  wait_timeout (optional, integer, 60)
    The timeout, in seconds, to wait until the certificate authority and the peer are available.
