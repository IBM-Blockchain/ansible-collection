Roles
=======

Roles can be used from the command line or in a playbook task. Ansible
executes each role, usually on the remote target node, and collects return
values.

While different roles perform different tasks, their interfaces and responses
follow similar patterns.

Role reference
----------------

Reference material for each role contains documentation on what parameters
certain roles accept and what values they expect those parameters to be.
